 * Interface used to listen at the most important points when Wicket performs an Ajax callback.

 * <p>
 * Each method can return JavaScript that will be used as a body of a function that is executed at the appropriate time.
 * If the method returns {@code null} or an empty string then it is ignored and no function will be executed for this
 * listener. Each JavaScript function receives arguments in the exact order as specified in the method's javadoc.

 * depend on some JavaScript library, by implementing
 * {@link org.apache.wicket.markup.html.IComponentAwareHeaderContributor} interface they can assure it will be loaded.
